## ⚡ Core Philosophy & Focus

I solve complex financial and analytical problems by combining quantitative methods, scalable data engineering, and software development. Currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Big Data Analytics at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & Vanilla CSS (Neobrutalism UI style: hard offset shadows, high-contrast thick borders, flat vibrant fills)
- **Database**: Neon (PostgreSQL Serverless)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Favicon**: Custom Star38 SVG favicon

-----

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Neobrutalist Design System**: Standard borders (`3px solid #1a1a1a`) and solid flat shadows (`5px 5px 0px #1a1a1a`) giving a tactile, physical feel to cards and interactive items.
2. **Dynamic Blogs Route**: Static site generated (SSG) pre-rendered articles under `/blogs/[slug]` featuring inline code snippets and clean typographic layouts.
3. **Live Guestbook**: Real-time message board using Next.js Server Actions connecting to a serverless Postgres database with automatic client-side polling.
4. **Scattered Social Cards**: Interactive, physics-inspired scattered cards on desktop and mobile that hover, tilt, and animate on touch.
5. **Custom Cursor**: Custom canvas mouse tracker with context-aware icon changes when hovering over links and buttons.
6. **Multi-Channel Social Footer**: Optimized, centered social icon row containing direct links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email.
